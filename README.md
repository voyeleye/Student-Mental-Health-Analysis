## Introduction
This is a Power BI project on the analysis of student mental health in a school. A detailed data analysis was carried out on the dataset by posing the right questions to be answered, data cleaning and manipulation, visualization, real-time interaction, garnering key insights, and providing recommendations as per student mental health.

## Problem Statement
1. How many students was the analysis carried out on?
2. How many students were married and single?
3. What is the percentage of students with mental health risks?
4. What school year had the most mental health illnesses?
5. What is the number of students actively seeking help?
6. Which gender was more prone to mental health illness?
7. Which age group had the most mental health issues?


## Skills or concepts demonstrated:

The following Power BI features were incorporated:
Quick Measure, slicers, filters, and visualizations

## Analysis

### Facts
One hundred (100) students in total were included in the analysis. Of the hundred (100), sixteen (16) were married, and eighty-four (84) were unmarried.
80.95% were at low risk for mental health issues. Of them, 5% had a high risk of mental health issues, and 13.1% had a medium risk.
The highest number of mental health problems were reported in year 1 compared to year 4.
The results of the investigation showed that mental health disorders were more common in women.
More teenagers than young adults experienced this mental disease.
Of these students, just six (6) are actively looking for assistance.

## Conclusion and Recommendation
It is clear from the examination of 100 students that mental health problems are a major concern, with participants exhibiting varied degrees of risk. The survey reveals an alarming pattern in which a sizable percentage of students—particularly those in their first year—experience mental health issues. It's interesting to note that the research highlights how common mental health illnesses are in women and teenagers, pointing to particular populations who may require specialized care.

The low number of students actively seeking help (6 out of 100) is one interesting observation. This suggests that there may be a disconnect between the student body and mental health services in terms of knowledge or availability.

In conclusion, it is critical to treat mental health issues and close the gap, particularly for women and young adults.
